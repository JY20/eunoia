# Summary of `eunoia_web/public` Directory Structure

This directory contains static assets that are publicly accessible and are served directly by the web server. Files in this directory are generally not processed by Webpack (unlike files in `src/`).

**Key Files:**

*   **`index.html`**: The main HTML page for the single-page application (SPA). React will inject the application into a DOM element within this file (typically a `<div>` with an id like `root`). It often contains placeholders for metadata, links to icon files, and the main script tag for the bundled application.
*   **`favicon.ico`**: The icon displayed in browser tabs and bookmarks.
*   **`logo192.png` / `logo512.png`**: PNG logo files of different sizes, often used for Progressive Web App (PWA) icons or favicons for different devices/contexts.
*   **`logo.jpg`**: A JPG version of the logo.
*   **`manifest.json`**: The web app manifest, which provides information about the application (like name, author, icon, description) in a JSON text file. It's crucial for PWAs, allowing users to "install" the web app to their home screen.
*   **`robots.txt`**: A file that tells web crawlers (like Googlebot) which pages or sections of the site should not be crawled or indexed.

This directory is essential for the base HTML structure and static assets like icons and the manifest file that define the application's presentation and PWA capabilities.
