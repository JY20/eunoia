# Summary of `backend/eunoia_backend/requirements.txt`

This file lists the Python package dependencies for the `eunoia_backend` Django application.

**Key Dependencies:**

*   **`Django`**: The core web framework used for the backend.
*   **`python-dotenv`**: For managing environment variables by loading them from a `.env` file.
*   **`openai`**: The official Python library for interacting with OpenAI APIs.
*   **`openai-agents`**: (Likely related to OpenAI, possibly for creating AI agents or specific agentic functionalities. Further investigation might be needed to pinpoint its exact role if it's a core feature).
*   **`Pillow`**: A Python Imaging Library fork, used for image processing (e.g., handling charity logos or uploaded documents).
*   **`djangorestframework`**: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs with Django.
*   **`django-cors-headers`**: A Django app that adds Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers to responses, essential for allowing the frontend (running on a different port/domain) to communicate with the backend API.

This file ensures that the correct versions of these packages are installed when setting up the backend environment.
