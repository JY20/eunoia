</p> -->

Eunoia is a radically transparent, advocate-centered giving platform built initially on the Aptos blockchain, and now expanding to be a **multi-chain solution supporting both Aptos and Polkadot**. We enable givers to track every penny from wallet ‚Üí charity ‚Üí spend in real-time. With an optional 0.20% "Amplify Impact" surcharge, Eunoia powers a self-funding marketing engine that grows the platform without burdening charities or donors.

Eunoia also aims to eliminate unnecessary middlemen, enabling donations to reach individuals directly‚Äîlike missionaries or independent charity workers in developing countries‚Äîwith full transparency and minimal fees.

## üîç The Problem Eunoia Solves

Traditional charitable giving often suffers from a lack of transparency, high intermediary fees, and delays in funds reaching the intended recipients. Donors are left wondering about the true impact of their contributions. Eunoia tackles these issues by leveraging the power of blockchain technology.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture Overview

Eunoia operates with a decoupled frontend and backend architecture:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend (React App - `@eunoia_web`)
*   Handles all user interactions, including browsing charities, connecting Aptos wallets, and initiating donations.
*   Communicates with the Django backend via REST APIs to fetch charity information, user data (future), and potentially submit registration details.
*   Interacts directly with the Aptos blockchain via the Aptos Wallet Adapter for donation transactions and smart contract calls.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend (Django App - `@eunoia_backend`)
*   Manages charity data: registration, verification, storing details like name, description, Aptos wallet address, and official documents.
*   Provides RESTful API endpoints for the frontend to consume (e.g., list charities, charity details, featured charities).
*   Handles administrative tasks, including charity verification via the Django Admin interface.
*   Manages static and media files (logos, registration documents).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Contracts
*   **Aptos Smart Contract:** Contains the core logic for receiving donations and distributing them to charities on the Aptos network.
*   **Polkadot Smart Contract:** Provides similar donation and charity management functionalities on Polkadot-compatible chains using ink!.

## üìò Smart Contract Details

The Eunoia platform utilizes smart contracts on both the Aptos and Polkadot networks to handle core donation logic, charity registration, and fund distribution transparently and securely.

### üîê Aptos Smart Contract Details (`eunoia.move`)

Located in `contract/sources/eunoia.move`, our contract implements the following key functionalities:

#### Core Resources and Tables
* `ContractData`: Main resource storing donation histories, charity wallets, and raised amounts
* `HistoryEntry`: Records individual donation details including charity, coin type, amount and timestamp
* Tables structure to efficiently store and retrieve donation and charity data

#### Key Functions
* `initialize_module`: Sets up the contract data structures
* `add_charity`: Registers a new charity with its wallet address
* `donate<CoinType>`: Processes donations of different coin types to registered charities
* `get_donation_history`: View function to retrieve a user's donation history
* `get_charity_raised_amount`: View function to check total raised by a charity per coin type
* `get_charity_wallet`: View function to retrieve a charity's wallet address

#### Events
* `DonateEvent`: Emitted when donations are made for transparent tracking
* `CharityRegisteredEvent`: Emitted when a new charity is registered

#### Security Features
* Comprehensive error handling
* Access control with module owner verification
* Checks to prevent unauthorized operations
* Balance validations before transfers

### üåê Contract Deployment (Aptos)

The smart contract is configured in `contract/Move.toml` and deployed to the Aptos network at address:
```
0x3940277b22c1fe2c8631bdce9dbcf020c3b8240a5417fa13ac21d37860f88011
```

### ü¶Ä Polkadot (ink!) Smart Contract Details (`eunoia2` module)

Located in `polkadot_contracts/eunoia/lib.rs`, our ink! smart contract provides donation and charity management functionalities for the Polkadot ecosystem. It's designed to be deployed on Substrate-based chains that support `pallet-contracts`.

#### Core Storage Items
*   `owner`: The `AccountId` (or `H160` for ink! 6+) of the contract administrator.
*   `histories`: A `Mapping` from a donor's account to a `Vec` of their `HistoryEntry` structs.
*   `charity_wallets`: A `Mapping` from a charity's name (String) to their wallet `AccountId` (or `H160`).
*   `charity_raised_amounts`: A `Mapping` from a charity's name to a `BTreeMap` storing amounts raised per coin type (String to `U256` or `u128`).

#### Key Structs and Events
*   `HistoryEntry`: Struct recording details of each donation (charity, coin, amount, donor, timestamp).
*   `DonateEvent`: Emitted when a donation is successfully processed.
*   `CharityRegisteredEvent`: Emitted when a new charity is added.
*   `Error`: Enum defining possible error conditions within the contract.

#### Key Functions
*   `new()`: Constructor to initialize the contract, setting the caller as the owner.
*   `add_charity(charity_name: String, charity_wallet: AccountId)`: Allows the owner to register a new charity.
*   `donate(charity_name: String, coin_name: String)`: A payable message allowing users to donate native tokens to a registered charity.
*   `get_donation_history(donor: AccountId)`: View function to retrieve a donor's history.
*   `get_charity_raised_amount(charity_name: String, coin_name: String)`: View function to check amounts raised by a charity.
*   `get_charity_wallet(charity_name: String)`: View function to get a charity's registered wallet.

#### Security and Design Considerations
*   Owner-restricted administrative functions (e.g., `add_charity`).
*   Payable messages for donations.
*   Use of `Mapping` for efficient storage and retrieval.
*   Events for off-chain tracking and UI updates.
*   Currently under development for ink! 6.0, which involves updates to account types (e.g., `H160`) and value types (e.g., `U256`).

### üåê Contract Deployment (Polkadot)
Deployment of the ink! contract involves compiling it to a Wasm blob and a metadata file using `cargo-contract build`. This bundle can then be deployed to a compatible Substrate chain via UI tools like Polkadot-JS Apps or programmatically. The specific deployment address will vary based on the target network and deployment instance.

## üîÑ Interaction Flow

1. User browses charities on the React frontend (data fetched from Django API).
2. User connects their Aptos wallet.
3. User selects a charity and initiates a donation.
4. React frontend interacts with the appropriate smart contract (Aptos or Polkadot via respective wallet adapters/libraries) to execute the donation transaction.
5. Transaction is recorded on the respective blockchain.
6. (Future) Backend might listen to blockchain events or periodically query the contract to update donation records.

## üîë Key Functionalities

### üìù Charity Registration
*   Charities can navigate to the `/register-charity` (or a similar route) on the frontend.
*   This form will eventually submit data to a Django backend API endpoint.
*   Currently, charity registration and initial data input are primarily managed via the Django templates (`/register-charity/` on the backend) and the Django Admin interface (`/admin/main/charity/add/`).
*   Admins can verify charities through the Django Admin panel.

### üí∏ Donation Process
*   Users connect their Aptos wallet (e.g., Petra) via the frontend.
*   They browse verified charities (data served by the Django API).
*   When a user decides to donate, the frontend interacts with the relevant smart contract (Aptos or Polkadot), guided by the selected charity's wallet address for the respective network.
*   The transaction occurs directly on the chosen blockchain.

### üëÅÔ∏è Transparency
*   **On-Chain Transactions:** All donations are blockchain transactions, inherently public and verifiable on an Aptos explorer.
*   **Verified Charities:** The backend maintains a list of charities, and admins can verify their legitimacy. Only verified charities are displayed for donation.
*   **Direct Fund Flow (Goal):** The architecture aims to send funds as directly as possible to the charity's registered wallet, as managed by the smart contract.
