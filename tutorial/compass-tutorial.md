### Step 3: Review Matched Movements

Compass will:
1. Match your query against specific charity movements using semantic search
2. Show you the top movement recommendations, each with a clear explanation
3. Display all matched charities, grouped by organization
4. Present an impact map for location-based movements when available

### Step 4: Select Charities and Donate

- Choose the charities or movements you want to support
- Adjust how much you wish to donate to each one; Compass will suggest allocations based on the best matches, but you remain in control
- You'll see the total amount, including a small optional platform fee (0.2%) to help us keep improving

### Step 5: Confirm & Make Your Donation

You've just made a difference :) Thank you!
